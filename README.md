## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for image classification using PyTorch on the FashionMNIST dataset. It implements and compares three different neural network architectures with increasing complexity:

1. **Basic Linear Model**: Simple baseline model
2. **Feedforward Neural Network**: With hidden layers and ReLU activation
3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Leveraging spatial features

The project includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, visualization tools, and model persistence capabilities.

## Key Features

- Complete PyTorch implementation from scratch
- Three different model architectures for comparison
- Detailed training and evaluation loops
- Comprehensive visualization suite including:
  - Sample images from dataset
  - Training progress tracking
  - Prediction examples with correct/incorrect labeling
  - Confusion matrix analysis
- Device-agnostic code (works on CPU and GPU)
- Model saving and loading functionality
- Helper functions for accuracy calculation and timing
- Clean, modular code structure

## Dataset

Advanced Features
Custom Training
Modify hyperparameters in the script:

python
# Hyperparameters
BATCH_SIZE = 64
LEARNING_RATE = 0.01
EPOCHS = 10
Adding New Models
Implement new architectures by extending nn.Module:

python
class CustomModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define layers
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Define forward pass
        return x
GPU Acceleration
The code automatically uses GPU if available. To force CPU:

python
device = torch.device("cpu")
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
CUDA Out of Memory: Reduce batch size

Slow Training: Enable GPU acceleration

Installation Errors: Use exact package versions

Debugging Tips
Set torch.manual_seed(42) for reproducibility

Print tensor shapes during forward pass

Visualize intermediate outputs

Future Improvements
Add more advanced architectures (ResNet, DenseNet)

Implement learning rate scheduling

Add data augmentation

Include hyperparameter tuning

Deploy as web application
